# Introduction

Hello Mr. Forlenza! After long days of work i have successfully anazalyed the NASA web server log from the year of 1995. Below you will see two graphs that i have constructed  which represent the most common IP addresses visited and  the amount of logins that occurs through certain days.


## Most Common IP Address

The first portion of the graph that I examined was the most common IP addresses. This would tell us how many devices or users utilize the following data log on a regular basis. During the study, I discovered the most common IP address, piweba3y.prodigy.com. The following data log had the maximum number of queries of over 10,000. Furthermore, 163.206.89.4 had the least the queries of IP addresses only averaging around 3,500 queris. This data would enable us to identify the sources that have utilized this data log the most and use it to determine what sort of information they frequently use or log in.

## Most Common Dates

The second section that I examined was the dates and number of searches that occurred throughout the month of July in 1995, which was the most common due to the proximity of the shuttle's launch. The data was obtained and some conclusions were drawn that on July 13 the Nasa log reached the most number of visits due to that being the day , when the commet collided with Jupiter. After the following increase in the graph, the number of searches decreased and stabilized.

## Suggestions
After doing an analysis to determine how to improve traffic to the target website, I came to the conclusion that We should keep track of more activities as they had a significant impact on the site. Adding to that idea, we should also attempt to gather more data by creating more graphs. More detailed information about the users and the IP addresses they accessed might provide insight into how people behave across the board.
