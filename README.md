# Introduction

Hello Mr. Forlenza! After long days of work i have successfully anazalyed the NASA web server log from the year of 1995. Below you will see two graphs that i have constructed  which represent the most common IP addresses visited and  the amount of logins that occurs through certain days.


## Most Common IP Address

The most common IP addresses are the first section of the graph that I examined. This would inform us of the more widespread usage of the following data log's devices or users. Among the items I discovered throughout the investigation was piweba3y.prodigy.com, which was the most common IP. The total number of queries in the following data log was 10000, which is the highest number. Prodigy.com also dominated the top 10 field, making it the most popular provider of IP addresses. We would be able to identify the sources that have used the datalog the most and utilize this information to determine the kinds of information they often used or recorded in the log.

## Most Common Dates

The second element I looked at was when and how many times it was searched during the entire month of July 1995, which was the most popular month because it was so close to the shuttle's launch. The data was gathered on July 13, when the comet made contact with Jupiter, and certain inferences were drawn from the investigation. The number of searches decreased and then stagnated after the next surge in the graph.

## Suggestions
After doing an analysis to determine how to improve traffic to the target website, I came to the conclusion that We should keep track of more activities as they had a significant impact on the site. Adding to that idea would be to attempt to gather more data that could support it by creating more graphs. More detailed information about the users and the IP addresses they accessed might provide insight into how people behave across the board.
